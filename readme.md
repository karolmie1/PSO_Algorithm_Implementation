How to run it:

Before you do anything load properties:
  source('workspace/PSO_Algorithm_Implementation/properties.R')

If you want to run the algorithm first load it:
  source('workspace/PSO_Algorithm_Implementation/metaheuristic_pattern.r')
and then execute:
  metaheuristicRun(initialization, startPoints, termination, evaluation)

if you don't want to initialize this stuff yourself you can use predefined functions located in: 
source('workspace/PSO_Algorithm_Implementation/utils.R')


To run tests: 
source('workspace/PSO_Algorithm_Implementation/testSuite.R')
